                    Gallery Heart is a charitable response to specific and unjust humanitarian crises.
                    <br><br>
                    Along with the wonderful help from creative people in our community we want to contribute to the relief of these devastations.
                    <br><br>
                    With limited time or money to provide substantial aid, we are using the greatest resource in our reachart.
                    <br><br>
                    Having carefully researched different organizations, we decided to contribute to 5 NGOs which do amazing work around the world.
                    <br><br>
                    These organizations provide aid, but also give importance to the development of the communities they help because regardless of every good intention, we understand that there are downfalls to charitable aid which can harm communities in the long run.
                    <br><br>
                    However, it is also crucial to understand that there are communities in devastating circumstances who desperately need our support and they need it now.

                    Our initiative only works with the willingness and generosity of artists. Artists donate their art to us, whether it is digital or physical pieces. We provide a platform to display their art.
                    <br><br>
                    Others can <span>browse out gallery</span>, if they see a piece they like, can go ahead and purchase it. They are given the option of <span>which NGO to support</span>.
                    <br><br>
                    Each piece has a <span>clear and detailed cost breakdown</span> for the Artwork itself (the artist can include, for example, the price of printing, or the cost of a frame) and the cost for us of to keep the website running (and average of monthly costs).
                    <br><br>
                    All the remaining profits go directly to the organization of their choice.
